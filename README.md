### [Road Network Improvement Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Romania/projects/2 "Project 2")
The Kaart team will focus on data improvements pertinent to foundational data in OSM, primarily in road networks. The current scope of editing will direct efforts to add and increase the integrity of the following: road connectivity, routing, road alignment, geometry, destinations, exits, and turn restrictions.
