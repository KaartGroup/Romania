# Romania Mapping Projects
This repository tracks the various mapping projects throughout Romania that are managed by [Kaart](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Romania/blob/master/KAART.md "Kaart").

## Projects

### [Signpost Review Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Romania/projects/1 "Project 1")
Motorway junctions play a key role in proper navigation and routing. The name of motorway junctions are commonly tagged as the name of the exit rather than the name of the destination. This project will focus on correcting signposts and adding other information from street level images.
