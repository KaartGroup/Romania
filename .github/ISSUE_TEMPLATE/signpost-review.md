### Scope of Work
Motorway junctions play a key role in proper navigation and routing. The name of motorway junctions are commonly tagged as the name of the exit rather than the name of the destination. This project will focus on correcting signposts and adding other information from street level images.

## Strategy
Motorway junctions with the `name:*` tag throughout Romania have been added to MapRoulette. Using street level images, editors will confirm the accuracy of the attributes tagged and make modifications as needed.
